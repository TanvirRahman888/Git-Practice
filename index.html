    <h2>Git-Practice</h2>
    <h2>Introduction to Git and GitHub</h2>
    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then. <br>It is used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tracking code changes</li>
            <li>Tracking who made changes</li>
            <li>Coding collaboration</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>What does Git do?
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Manage projects with <b>Repositories</b></li>
        <li><b>Clone</b> a project to work on a local copy</li>
        <li>Control and track changes with <b>Staging</b> and <b>Committing</b></li>
        <li><b>Branch</b> and <b>Merge</b> to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project</li>
        <li><b>Pull</b> the latest version of the project to a local copy</li>
        <li><b>Push</b> local updates to the main project</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Working with Git</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Initialize Git on a folder, making it a <b>Repository</b></li>
        <li>Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder</li>
        <li>When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered <b>modified</b></li>
        <li>You select the modified files you want to <b>Stage</b></li>
        <li>The <b>Staged</b> files are <b>Committed</b>, which prompts Git to store a <b>permanent</b> snapshot of the files</li>
        <li>You can revert back to any previous commit.</li>
        <li>Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Git?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Over 70% of developers use Git!</li>
        <li>Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.</li>
        <li>Developers can see the full history of the project.</li>
        <li>Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Git is not the same as GitHub.</li>
        <li>GitHub makes tools that use Git.</li>
        <li>GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.</li>
        <li>In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.</li>
    </ul>
